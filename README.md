# Seasonal-Analysis-and-Price-Optimization-of-Hotel-Bookings-and-Ancillary-Services

# Project Background

Grand Meridian Hotel (GMH), a four-star hotel, opened its doors in 2004 in one of the historic cities of England. Designed to blend modern comfort with classic Georgian architecture, the hotel quickly became popular with both business travelers attending regional conferences and leisure guests drawn to the city’s cultural attractions.

Over the past two decades, GMH has expanded modestly, now offering 182 guest rooms, a small but well-equipped conference suite, an on-site bistro, and a spa treatment room. The hotel positions itself as a premium option for visitors who value personalized service, central location, and a more intimate atmosphere compared to large chain hotels

Despite maintaining strong occupancy, management struggled to pinpoint which guest segments and if pricing strategies drove the most profit. This project was initiated to uncover revenue performance patterns across room types, booking channels, and guest segments, assess the impact of discounts and seasonal adjustments, and develop an interactive Tableau dashboard to guide strategic pricing, marketing focus, and long-term revenue optimization.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

•	Possible missed opportunities to focus on the most profitable segment.

•	Marketing funds may be diluted by targeting both segments equally.

•	Service offerings may not align with the highest-value guest preferences.

Grand Meridian Hotel database structure as seen below consists of three tables: Hotel-Bookings, Ancillary _Services, Room _Rates Table, with a total row count of 12,397 records.

A description of each table is as follows:

• Table 1: hotel_bookings_data

• Table 2: ancillary _services

• Table 3: room _rates

# Executive Summary

•	This project analyzed GMH’s hotel performance to understand revenue drivers, guest segmentation, and the impact of pricing strategies.

•	Through analysis identified that room revenue dominates, ancillary services are underutilized, and discounts dilute profitability without boosting revenue.

•	Corporate guests remain the most stable segment, while leisure guests show strong seasonality but lower yield.

•	The findings highlight opportunities to optimize pricing, strengthen direct bookings, and grow ancillary revenue for improved profitability.



The following sections will expand on general overview the hotel bookings data, optimize pricing, and grow ancillary revenue for improved profitability.

Guest Segments: Leisure guests dominate (60%) compared to corporate (40%)

Booking Channels: Online and OTA channels are strong contributors, with Direct trailing.

Key indicators ;

Total Revenue: £11.9M (Rooms + Ancillary).

ADR (Average Daily Rate): £240.74,

Occupancy: 68.7%;

•	The room rates are high, suggesting the hotel attracts guests willing to pay premium prices, a sign of pricing strength.

•	However, the occupancy below 70% implies that demand elasticity is at play i.e., raising or maintaining high rates may be suppressing bookings slightly.

RevPAR: £165.48; 

•Healthy but not maximized; it reflects that revenue per available room is solid, yet occupancy constraints prevent stronger returns.

Segment Performance

•	Leisure guests contribute ~53% of total revenue, slightly higher than corporate guests (~47%).

•	Corporate RevPAR trends upward until June, dips mid-year (June–November), and recovers towards year-end, aligning with Leisure RevPAR — indicating seasonal demand differences.

•	Both segments peak in June, suggesting this is the hotel’s high season

Revenue & Occupancy Trends

•	From January to August, occupancy outpaces revenue, suggesting discounting or low-rate bookings during high-demand months.

•	From August to December, revenue and occupancy align, showing improved pricing consistency and possibly reduced discounting.

Revenue by Room Type

•	Suites generate the highest revenue, followed by Deluxe Rooms, with Standard Rooms contributing the least, this reflects value of rooms surpass the frequency of use.

•	The hotel is overly dependent on room sales, with ancillary services underutilized.

•	Expanding non-room revenue streams (spa, dining, events, transport) could:

o	Enhance total revenue per guest,

o	Smooth out seasonal fluctuations,

o	Increase guest retention through experience-based offerings.
