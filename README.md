# Seasonal-Analysis-and-Price-Optimization-of-Hotel-Bookings-and-Ancillary-Services

# Project Background

Grand Meridian Hotel (GMH), a four-star hotel, opened its doors in 2004 in one of the historic cities of England. Designed to blend modern comfort with classic Georgian architecture, the hotel quickly became popular with both business travelers attending regional conferences and leisure guests drawn to the city’s cultural attractions.

Over the past two decades, GMH has expanded modestly, now offering 182 guest rooms, a small but well-equipped conference suite, an on-site bistro, and a spa treatment room. The hotel positions itself as a premium option for visitors who value personalized service, central location, and a more intimate atmosphere compared to large chain hotels

Despite maintaining strong occupancy, management struggled to pinpoint which guest segments and if pricing strategies drove the most profit. This project was initiated to uncover revenue performance patterns across room types, booking channels, and guest segments, assess the impact of discounts and seasonal adjustments, and develop an interactive Tableau dashboard to guide strategic pricing, marketing focus, and long-term revenue optimization.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

•	Possible missed opportunities to focus on the most profitable segment.

•	Marketing funds may be diluted by targeting both segments equally.

•	Service offerings may not align with the highest-value guest preferences.

•	Grand Meridian Hotel database structure as seen below consists of three tables: Hotel-Bookings, Ancillary _Services, Room _Rates Table, with a total row count of 12,397 records.

A description of each table is as follows:

• Table 1: hotel_bookings_data

• Table 2: ancillary _services

• Table 3: room _rates

# Executive Summary

•	This project analyzed GMH’s hotel performance to understand revenue drivers, guest segmentation, and the impact of pricing strategies.

•	Through analysis identified that room revenue dominates, ancillary services are underutilized, and discounts dilute profitability without boosting revenue.

•	Corporate guests remain the most stable segment, while leisure guests show strong seasonality but lower yield.

•	The findings highlight opportunities to optimize pricing, strengthen direct bookings, and grow ancillary revenue for improved profitability.



The following sections will expand on general overview the hotel bookings data, optimize pricing, and grow ancillary revenue for improved profitability.
